You glide respectfully around the edge
Trying so carefully not to pledge your existence
Congratulations you passed the test
Now step up and join the rest
(Your existence)
Still you shuffle on looking in
Don't be so shameful it's not a sin
(Your existence)
One day you'll understand the gift of freedom
That's when you shall really bloom
(Your existence)
Don't just contemplate
Put it into action
Make your ideas and dreams come true
(Your existence)
Take up the space that you need to
Stretch out your arms and make a claim
(Your existence)
