I'm glad you could meet me
I'm here about your son
I've never seen a mind like his
Especially so young

He's got a gift for numbers
Never known before
An outstanding genius
He shouldn't be ignored

You must be mistaken
He's useless and he's weak
I see no sign of genius
The boy can hardly speak

He just sits there, lifeless
For hours at a time
No expression on his face
His eyes staring into space!

How can you be so heartless
There must be so much more that we can do

Who are you to judge me?
You don't even know what we've been through

Just give him more attention
You'll see there's more to him than meets the eye

Fine, I'll try to help the child.
Better not wasting my time!
